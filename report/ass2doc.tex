\section{Advanced functionality test plan}

\begin{testplan}{Block movement}
\test{All blocks move at a constant horizontal speed.}{Start the game and observe block movement.}{Blocks move at the same constant speed and do not accelerate by themselves, except for the starting block.}{As expected.}
\test{Each row of blocks must move in the opposite direction to the row above it.}{Start the game and observe block movement.}{Adjacent rows move in opposite directions, except for the starting block.}{As expected.}
\end{testplan}

\begin{testplan}{Player velocity}
\test{Pressing the joystick left or right while the player is supported by a block sets the player in continuous horizontal motion at a constant speed relative to the block in the appropriate direction.}{Move the player onto a moving safe block and press joystick left and right.}{The player will move left when the left and right when the left and right joysticks are pressed, respectively, at a speed relative to the block.}{As expected.}
\test{When in horizontal motion, the player's horizontal velocity must be greater than that of the block.}{Move the player onto a moving safe block and press the joystick against the direction of motion.}{The player makes progress against the direction of the block.}{As expected.}
\test{If the player is moving horizontally on a supporting block and the joystick is pressed in the opposite direction, the player stops moving relative to the supporting block.}{Move the player onto a moving safe block, then press joystick left and then right.}{The player begins moving left relative to the block, then stops moving relative to the block and is carried by its motion alone.}{As expected.}
\test{If the player is moving horizontally on a supporting block, and the joystick is pressed in the same direction as current movement, then the player continues to move at the same speed in the current direction.}{When the player is stationary, press joystick left or right, then press the joystick the same direction again.}{The player moves in the direction of the joystick and does not speed up or slow down.}{As expected.}
\test{If the player is moving horizontally on a supporting block and the joystick is not pressed, then the player continues to move at the same speed in the current direction.}{When the player is stationary, press and release either joystick left or right.}{The player continues moving in the direction the joystick is pressed after it is released.}{As expected.}
\test{If the player is not supported by a block, then it will commence to accelerate downwards.}{Guide the player off a safe block until it is not supported by any block.}{The player will start to accelerate downwards.}{As expected.}
\test{If the player is moving horizontally before leaving the support of a block, then the player must continue to move horizontally at the same speed while accelerating downwards, so that a parabolic flight path will be observed.}{Move the player off a moving safe block.}{The player will keep its horizontal velocity but accelerate downwards according to gravity.}{As expected.}
\test{If the player is moving without support of a block and the player lands on a safe block, it will then immediately begin to move horizontally in the same speed and direction as the block, and all vertical motion will cease.}{Move the player off a moving safe block so that it falls and lands on another moving safe block.}{When the player lands, it will immediately begin to move horizontally in the same speed and direction as the block, and all vertical motion will cease.}{As expected.}
\test{If the player is moving without support of a block, and its Sprite collides with the end of a safe block (from the side), then its horizontal motion becomes zero, and it continues to accelerate downward.}{Make the player jump off a block and collide with the end of another safe block from the side.}{The player's horizontal motion becomes zero and it continues to accelerate downward.}{As expected.}
\test{All other collisions between the player and safe blocks are treated in a manner consistent with the combined motion.}{From a lower row of blocks, make the player jump into a safe block on the row above.}{The player is given an upward velocity passes upward through the block above, keeping the horizontal velocity of its previous block and accelerating vertically downwards.}{Not implemented.}
\test{Any collision with an unsafe block results in death.}{Guide the player into an unsafe block by standing or jumping into it.}{The player dies and a life is deducted.}{Not implemented.}
\end{testplan}

\begin{testplan}{Player jumping}
\test{Pressing the joystick up while the player is supported by a block causes the player to jump.}{Press the joystick up while the player is supported by a block.}{The player is given an upward velocity.}{Not implemented.}
\test{After UP is pressed, the player should commence to move upwards. Any horizontal motion should continue, and the acceleration provision when the player is not supported by a block will take effect.}{Press joystick up while on a safe block with horizontal motion.}{The player will retain the previous horizontal motion of the block while being given a new upwards velocity.}{Not implemented.}
